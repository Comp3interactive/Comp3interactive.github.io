      "So the first thing I'll be writing in here is the fact that, since starting my new job role as a React Web Developer, I've realised how much I enjoy web development! Surprise, surprise...

      "It runs smoothly and it rates quite highly during page analysis so what more could I ask for?",
      "Anyway... The main use for this Dev Log page is, as you might have guessed, dev logs for when I start to create new games! There aren't currently any in the pipeline but it never hurts to think ahead!
